# OpenUPM: SNAM 16k

Static Native Array MonoBehaviour for a 16K-player game is a tool I am designing with the goal of creating a single-server multiplayer game capable of supporting up to 128x128 (16,384) players. Achieving this requires extensive use of the JobSystem and Compute Shaders to share and process arrays efficiently.

This tool is specifically designed to store primitive values in a native array of exactly 16,384 items, optimized for computation using the JobSystem and Shaders.
